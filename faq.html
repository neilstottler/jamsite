            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Can I make a -</h2>
            <p>Let's stop you there: yes, if it's related to Team Fortress 2. If it's lewd or NSFW, though, we would prefer you hosted it elsewhere and post a link, marked as NSFW, to it, rather than uploading it directly to the tf2maps site - this stops it being previewed on the front page.</p>

            <h2>Can I enter on another day?</h2>
            <p>Yes - you can enter on whatever 72hr period you wish, though we suggest you do so before the normal contest time. Simply post the dates/times you wish to enter in the jam thread, and we'll make a list.
                <br>
                We can't promise to provide the same amount of support for people entering outside the normal time, but we'll do our best.
            </p>

            <h2>Can I collaborate with someone else?</h2>
            <p>Yes! Make sure to credit everybody involved when you make your upload though.</p>

            <h2>Do I need to be a TF2Maps member to join?</h2>
            <p>Nope! Or, well, sort of. You'll need to join the site to upload your entry, but this is open to everybody, even those who've never been here before.</p>

            <h2>What can I do before the Jam starts?</h2>
            <p>This depends on what it is you want to do with the Jam. Do you want to go from a completely blank slate to a finished project, or meticulously plan every detail before opening your chosen tool? Either is fine.
                <br>
                What we don't want people doing is continuing with half-finished or already-in-development projects. The Jam is a great time to flex your creative muscles and try something new. 
            </p>

            <h2>What if I don't want to abide by all these cruel and restrictive rules?</h2>
            <p>That's cool. We're not fussed. We're glad you're joining us! However, please let us know if you're doing that - it's not fair to other people if some get to start earlier, say. You probably won't get the medal, though.</p>

            <h2>Can I participate on the livestream?</h2>
            <p>Yes! We have severs running for the duration of the Jam, which we will be using for several of our segments as well as map testing. So feel free to join at any time, and you may end up having some airtime! We also have frequent 'Jam Ketchup' sessions to showcase the community's work over the Jam, so if you make something it's likely to show up!</p>

            <h2>How can I get feedback on my project?</h2>
            <p>The two best ways are to post a thread on the forums, and to join the <a href="">discord</a> and ask people what they think - we're always happy to help. If you want your map tested, similarly join the discord and ask - we can show you how to get it added to our <a href="">map testing list</a>. There are a few other rules that maps need to abide by for us to test them (since doing otherwise can break our servers) - see <a href="">here</a>. You can also find more information for map testing <a href="">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>I want someone to collaborate with me!</h2>
            <p>This isn't a question. However: post in the thread, and maybe someone will offer to join you. (It usually helps your chances to say both what you're good at and what ideas you already have.)</p>

            <h2>What are these extra rules for testing maps?</h2>
            <p>Don't use special characters or capital letters in your filename.
                Maps must be able to spawn at least 24 players (12 per team).
                Include some lighting - no fullbright maps.
                If your map requires point_servercommands to be active, then contact an admin before running it. We reserve the right to refuse any map like this.
                We will be running a separate server for MVM maps. Speak to an admin to have your map tested on this.</p>

            <h2>When does the Charity Drive start and how long will it last?</h2>
            <p>It will start alongside the Jam, and will be linked accordingly. Once running, you can then donate at will. We'll be monitoring the drive closely in the weeks after the Jam, so feel free to donate in that time as well.</p>

            <h2>Can I get both medals?</h2>
            <p>If you fit the criteria for both, of course!</p>

            <h2>Can I get the Charity Medal if I don't participate in the Jam?</h2>
            <p>Sure! We'd really love to have you on board for the Jam as well, though this isn't necessary when donating.</p>

            <h2>When will I receive my medals?</h2>
            <p>We give out medals manually, so we need to wait until all entries are submitted, and donations made! Then of course, we need to sort through it all! We plan for everyone to have received their medals around mid-late August, but we can't make any guarantees.</p>
